# 🌦️ Indigenous Weather Forecasting Challenge

This project aims to predict **rainfall intensity (heavy, medium, small, none) in the next 12–24 hours** using data collected from farmers in the **Pra River Basin, Ghana**, combining:

- Measured rainfall from gauges  
- Indigenous Ecological Indicators (IEIs)  
- Farmer forecasts & confidence levels  
- Location and time of forecast

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone repo & enter folder
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>.git
cd indigenous-weather-forecasting
````

### 2. Create virtual environment (Python 3.8)

* **Windows (PowerShell)**:

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **Mac/Linux**:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📊 Workflow

1. **EDA** → Explore dataset (missingness, distributions, correlations).
2. **Feature Engineering** → Encode categorical vars, extract datetime features.
3. **Modeling** → Start with RandomForest/LightGBM, then optimize.
4. **Submission** → Save predictions in `submissions/` in the correct format.

Do you also want me to write the `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` right after this so your repo is ready to initialize?
