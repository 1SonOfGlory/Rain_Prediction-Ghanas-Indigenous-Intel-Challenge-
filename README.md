## 📖 Overview

This project addresses the challenge of predicting **rainfall intensity (heavy, medium, small, none) in the next 12–24 hours**. The model leverages a unique dataset from the **Pra River Basin, Ghana**, that combines modern meteorological data with Indigenous Ecological Indicators (IEIs) and local farmers' traditional knowledge. Our primary goal is to **integrate machine learning techniques with indigenous knowledge** to enhance climate resilience for local farming communities.

The dataset includes:
- **Measured Rainfall:** Data from rain gauges.
- **Indigenous Ecological Indicators (IEIs):** Observations from nature that predict weather.
- **Farmer Forecasts:** Predictions and confidence levels from local farmers.
- **Geospatial & Temporal Data:** Location and time of each forecast.

## 📊 Project Workflow

The general workflow for this project follows these steps:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate the dataset for missing values, distributions, and correlations.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Process raw data by encoding categorical variables and extracting relevant features from timestamps.
3.  **Modeling:** Start with baseline machine learning models like **Random Forest** and progress to more advanced gradient-boosting models like **LightGBM** or **XGBoost**.
4.  **Evaluation:** Use cross-validation and leaderboard submissions to evaluate model performance.
5.  **Submission:** Format your final predictions and save them in the `submissions/` directory.
